        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
        <h4>A dedicated Fullstack developer based in Hyderabad, India üìç</h4>
        <p>I am a proficient full stack web developer
           with a diverse skill set encompassing
            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I specialize
             in harnessing the power of React to create
              dynamic and responsive user interfaces.
               My expertise extends to the backend as well,
                utilizing Node.js and Express to develop 
                robust server-side applications and RESTful
                 APIs. I am experienced in working with 
                 databases like MongoDB and PostgreSQL,
                  enabling me to craft seamless and 
                  efficient web experiences from concept
                   to deployment.</p>
